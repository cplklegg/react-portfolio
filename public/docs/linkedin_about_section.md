## ðŸ”¹ About Section:
I'm a full stack blockchain developer and educator passionate about building real-world Web3 solutions and empowering others to understand the decentralized frontier. Under the name **CryptoMachine Gene**, I specialize in developing and deploying secure smart contracts, architecting scalable dApps, and translating complex blockchain concepts into actionable insight.

With hands-on experience across Ethereum and EVM chains, I work with Solidity, Hardhat, Foundry, React, and Tailwind to bring decentralized applications to life. My background also includes crypto consulting, blockchain education, and market analysis â€” all delivered through a private sector lens via **New World Cryptos, PMA**, where freedom and knowledge intersect.
